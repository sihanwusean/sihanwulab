I am interested in and have an extensive background in cancer genetics and genomics. After graduating from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) majored in Biotechnology, I obtained my Ph.D. training at SYSU,  where I studied genetic alterations in brain tumor. I then initiated my postdoctoral research at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, UC San Diego, and Stanford University, under Dr. Paul Mischel's mentorship, and studied the structure and function of ecDNA in cancer, revealing its circular shape and the functional impact of its unique physical conformation. In 2021, I was awarded by the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas and joined the faculty of Children’s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern as an assistant professor in pediatrics. I am enthusiastic about studying the molecular function and molecular basis of ecDNA, and trying to leverage this knowledge to develop effective approaches to eliminate ecDNA in cancer as novel oncogene targeting strategies.

## Postdoc Positions in Cancer Genetics, Genomics, and Immunology

Postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratories of Drs. Zhijian ‘James’ Chen lab and Sihan Wu at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Postdocs recruited via this pathway will be housed and supported in the Chen lab in the Molecular Biology department, and co-mentored by Dr. Wu at the Children’s Research Institute.


The Chen lab studies innate immune sensing and signaling of nucleic acids, focusing on the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. This pathway has been shown to be important for many physiological and pathological processes. The lab is interested in dissecting the signaling mechanisms of the cGAS pathway as well as its role in immune defense against tumor development. 


The Wu lab studies the molecular functions and molecular dependencies of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in human cancer, including its replication, segregation, transcription, and repair, with an aim to develop effective approaches to tackle these mechanisms to eliminate ecDNA in cancer as therapeutic strategies. 


The Chen and Wu labs have recently received generous support from the Cancer Grand Challenges grant funded by Cancer Research UK and the US National Cancer Institute. The two labs will co-mentor postdocs to study how ecDNA cancers evade the immune system. Applicants who are intellectually curious and interested in science that bridges cancer genetics, genomics, and immunology are encouraged to apply.


Postdoctoral scientist in the lab will conduct cutting-edge research in a protected, interactive, highly collaborative, and well-funded environment, with access to shared facilities including sequencing, bioinformatics, imaging, metabolomics, flow cytometry, molecular pathology, and mouse genome engineering.


Qualifications for these positions include Ph.D. and/or M.D. degree(s) (or anticipate receiving their degrees in the near future) with less than 2 years of postdoctoral experience. Candidates with relevant training involving DNA and chromatin biology, genetics, genomics, epigenetics, signal transduction, immunology, and bioinformatics, especially with both wet-lab and dry-lab experience, are particularly encouraged to apply.


Interested applicants should submit the following documents **assembled into one PDF file** to ``Zhijian.Chen@UTSouthwestern.edu`` and ``Sihan.Wu@UTSouthwestern.edu`` 


1. A Cover Letter describing your interest in this position.
2. A CV listing your education, training background, publications, and skill set.
3. Two Reference Letters, including from your current mentor(s).
4. \*A 2-page Research Statement / Proposal summarizing your current research achievement and / or future research interest. (* Optional item. You can submit it later upon request.)
